# üìù MERN Stack Todo Application with Zod

A full-stack Todo app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrated with Zod for backend validation. This application allows users to add, view, and delete todos, and demonstrates complete client-server communication with data validation.

---

## üìö Topics Covered

- React Components and Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Node.js & Express server setup
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- Zod validation for backend request data
- Connecting React frontend to a Node.js backend

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (with Vite)
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS *(optional)*

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- Zod (for input validation)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup

- Install **Node.js** and **npm**
- Install **MongoDB** and ensure it is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
# Create React app using Vite
npm create vite@latest todo-frontend
cd todo-frontend
npm install
npm install axios
npm run dev
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
```bash
# Create a new backend directory
mkdir todo-backend
cd todo-backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors zod
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Zod Integration
Install Zod for validation:
```bash
npm install zod
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting Frontend to Backend
- Establish a connection between your React frontend and Node.js backend.
- Make API calls from the frontend to interact with the backend endpoints.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
- Start both the React and Node.js servers.
- Open your to-do app in a browser and verify its functionality

By following these steps, you'll gain practical insights into building a MERN stack application with Zod integration, ensuring both frontend and backend components work seamlessly.
